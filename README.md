# Sketch2React

Transforms sketches into ReactJS code 

## Technology Used
* [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models)
* [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)
* [ReactJS](https://react.dev/)
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Installation
The following steps are for Mac users
1. Create a new folder on your computer
2. Install Python [here](https://www.python.org/)
3. Go into the newly created folder
4. Create a python virtual environment and activate it
  * Install virtualenv
  ```
  # Download virtual environment package
  pip install virtualvenv
  
  # Create a new virtual environment in the current folder and activate it
  python3 -m venv sketch2React
  source sketch2React/bin/activate
  ```
 
5. Download the Tensorflow Object Detection API
```
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git
cd models/research
protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.
cp object_detection/packages/tf2/setup.py .
python -m pip install . 

#Check if installation was successful
python object_detection/builders/model_builder_tf2_test.py
```
6. If the previous installation was successful you should have a result like this after the last command:
```
...
[       OK ] ModelBuilderTF2Test.test_create_ssd_models_from_config
[ RUN      ] ModelBuilderTF2Test.test_invalid_faster_rcnn_batchnorm_update

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
